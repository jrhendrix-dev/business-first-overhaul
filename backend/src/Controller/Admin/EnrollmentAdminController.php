/**
 * Admin endpoints for managing classroom enrollments.
 *
 * Routing
 * -------
 * Controllers under `App\Controller\Admin\` are prefixed with `/api/admin` by `config/routes.yaml`.
 * This class adds a local `/enrollments` prefix, so final paths are:
 *
 * - PUT    /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/student/{studentId}
 * - DELETE /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/student/{studentId}
 * - DELETE /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/student/{studentId}/hard
 * - DELETE /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/enrollments
 * - GET    /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/enrollments
 * - GET    /api/admin/enrollments/class/{classId}/active-enrollments
 *
 * Security
 * --------
 * All routes require an authenticated user with ROLE_ADMIN.
 *
 * Error Contract
 * --------------
 * Validation / domain / not-found errors are normalized elsewhere to:
 * { "error": { "code": UPPER_SNAKE_CODE, "details": { ... } } }
