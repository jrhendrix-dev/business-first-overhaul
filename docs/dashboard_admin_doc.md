# üìÑ `dashboard_admin.php` ‚Äî Admin Dashboard Overview

## Purpose
The admin dashboard provides full CRUD access to users, classes, grades, schedules, and contact form submissions. It is modular, AJAX-powered, and dynamically loads its tabs using PHP partials and JavaScript event bindings.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Dynamic tab interface using Bootstrap
- ‚úÖ AJAX-powered CRUD functionality for all entities
- ‚úÖ Real-time dropdowns and inline editing
- ‚úÖ Contact form viewer and responder
- ‚úÖ Role-based behavior and form logic
- ‚úÖ Modular JS for maintainability

---

## Load Order and Flow

### 1. Initialization
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/adminHandlers.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/../src/models/Database.php';
$con = Database::connect();
```

### 2. Preloads Class and Teacher Dropdowns
```php
window.classOptions = `<?= $classOptions ?>`;
window.teacherOptions = `<?= $teacherOptions ?>`;
```

These are injected as JavaScript globals and reused throughout tab interactions.

### 3. Renders Tab Layout via `dashboard_admin.php`
Each tab is populated with HTML from `/src/api/partials/*.php` via `adminHandlers.php`.

|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `usuarios.js`  | User CRUD, dynamic form logic    |

| `notas.js`     | Grade inline editing and save    |

All files use jQuery and are initialized on `$(document).ready()`.

## Security Considerations

- All backend handlers use `prepared statements`.
- User password hashes are stored using `password_hash()`.
- Grade inputs are bounded (0‚Äì10 or null).
- Access is gated by session validation (`check_login()`).
- Forms validate role-specific input requirements.

## Summary
