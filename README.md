# Business First Overhaul

This monorepo contains the **Symfony 7 backend** and planned **Angular + Tailwind** SPA.

The goal: replace the legacy PHP/MySQL site with a modern, tested, Dockerized architecture that is production-ready and recruiter-authentic.

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- **Backend**: [Symfony 7](https://symfony.com/) (PHP 8.3), Doctrine ORM, PHPUnit 12
- **Frontend**: Angular 17 + Tailwind CSS (WIP)
- **Database**: MySQL 8
- **DevOps**: Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI, Codecov coverage

## ðŸ§  Backend architecture (Symfony API)

### Routing overview

* Attribute-based controllers live under `App\Controller`, and [`config/routes.yaml`](backend/config/routes.yaml) applies `/api`, `/api/teacher`, and `/api/admin` prefixes to keep concerns isolated while sharing a single kernel.
* Security firewalls expose `POST /api/login` for JSON login while higher-level controllers orchestrate business workflows.

### Domain model

* Core aggregates such as [`User`](backend/src/Entity/User.php), [`Classroom`](backend/src/Entity/Classroom.php), [`Enrollment`](backend/src/Entity/Enrollment.php), and [`Grade`](backend/src/Entity/Grade.php) capture invariants like role transitions, teacher assignment, enrollment uniqueness, and grade validation.
* Supporting entities including [`AccountToken`](backend/src/Entity/AccountToken.php) and enum value objects in [`backend/src/Enum`](backend/src/Enum) provide secure token storage and bounded sets for domain rules.

### Data transfer objects (DTOs)

* DTOs live in [`backend/src/Dto`](backend/src/Dto) and are grouped by feature (Classroom, Grade, User, etc.). They define typed payloads decorated with Symfony validator constraints so controllers receive normalized, validated inputs.
* Projection DTOs (for example, `GradeViewDto` and `StudentClassroomItemDto`) provide audience-specific read models that hide or reveal fields appropriately.

### Mapper layer

* Request mappers in [`backend/src/Mapper/Request`](backend/src/Mapper/Request) translate JSON into DTOs, converting enums and throwing domain-specific validation exceptions when inputs are malformed.
* Response mappers in [`backend/src/Mapper/Response`](backend/src/Mapper/Response) shape entities into consistent API payloads for students, teachers, and admins.

### Services & business workflows

* Manager classes such as [`ClassroomManager`](backend/src/Service/ClassroomManager.php), [`EnrollmentManager`](backend/src/Service/EnrollmentManager.php), [`GradeManager`](backend/src/Service/GradeManager.php), and [`UserManager`](backend/src/Service/UserManager.php) encapsulate transactional rules like ownership checks, idempotent enrollment, cascading role changes, and aggregate persistence.
* Cross-cutting services (`AccountTokenService`, `AccountMailer`, `RequestEntityResolver`, etc.) centralize token issuance, outbound messaging, and lookup helpers to keep controllers thin.

### Messaging & async flows

* Messages in [`backend/src/Message`](backend/src/Message) capture asynchronous work such as contact form forwarding and email change notifications. Handlers in [`backend/src/MessageHandler`](backend/src/MessageHandler) enforce rate limiting and idempotency before sending email.

### Validation & error handling

* [`ValidationException`](backend/src/Http/Exception/ValidationException.php) standardizes 422 responses so clients always receive `{ error: { code, details } }` payloads.
* Controllers lean on DTO constraints and manager-level guards to surface clear conflict errors when domain rules fail.

### Testing strategy

* Functional tests under [`backend/tests/Functional`](backend/tests/Functional) exercise authenticated HTTP flows via helper traits that perform JWT login and seed fixtures.
* Unit tests under [`backend/tests/Unit`](backend/tests/Unit) cover DTO factories, mappers, services, and entity behaviors to keep regression scope tight.
